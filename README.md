1. Formulated data science problem to test the hypothesis of price sensitivity driving churn for PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility, requiring historical customer and pricing data for predictive modeling.

2. Performed exploratory data analysis, validating the correlation between price sensitivity and churn while suggesting additional data sources for augmentation.

3. Developed and evaluated a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn, documenting advantages and disadvantages for the specific use case.

4. Prepared an abstract slide summarizing project findings, emphasizing the crucial metric for the client and demonstrating the potential financial impact of the predictive model on the client's bottom line.
